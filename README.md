**VibeCheckMyProf** is a service that performs sentiment analysis on reviews for professors on the site **ratemyprofessors.com**, providing users with an appealing visual summary of recent reviews without having to scroll and read all of them. Users can compare the VibeCheck score with numerical ratings on the ratemyprofessors site and can also view a visualization of VibeCheck comment scores over time.


### Use Cases:
- A first year anxious student cannot decide which Math Professor to take a math course with, they learn about VibeCheckMyProf to get an overview of each professorâ€™s reviews without having to read any comments.
- A CPSC professor wants to know what recent students think of them, so they use VibeCheckMyProf at the beginning of the semester and at the end to track how feedback has shifted over time.
- A student in their final year realizes they need an elective outside of their major, with limited time and familiarity with other department's professors, they use VibeCheckMyProf to compare overall scores of potential professors, making quick decisions without having to read individual comments.
