But Gregor talks really slow so sometimes it is pretty annoying"

I had no programming experience prior to this course, but if you listen to him you will most likely succeed. DO NOT fall behind because the concepts are connected. The exams are fair and relevant to the material covered. Course taken: 2023W1"

Taking his course felt like learning how to speak a language fluently in 3 months. Students can't help each other on psets, and the learning environment  is just depressing and unhealthy. Pls avoid if it's not a major req."

It's way too fast-paced and heavy, especially if you have no previous experience (me)"

Attending lectures is essential and make sure you actually listen when he says to try the problems in the videos on your own instead of just following along. He was a fair teacher and funny.

Furthermore, I'm not a fan of the way he teaches, as I leave lectures confused."
