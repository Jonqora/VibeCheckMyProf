He forgets to upload resources, makes typos on slides/assignments, ignores all questions about logistics/exams, does not give practice problems, forgets to attend office hours, etc. He is lucky that Victor was an awesome TA and carried the course. Do not take this course if you didn't do MATH 220 or 223!",

An issue with the course: some TAs, except a couple, clearly weren't familiar with the material and their grading was weird. TA assignments need to be more thorough for this course. Easy stuff.",

Assignments could be annoying to do since what we could or could not do was unclear. The software used (Julia Pluto) could be tricky to get working. I learned a ton and highly recommend.",
